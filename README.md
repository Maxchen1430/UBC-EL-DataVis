# UBC Extended Learning - Data Visualization
This repository includes my Exploratory Data Analysis and Final Project for the "Data Visualization" course in the UBC Extended Learning - Key Capabilities for Data Science program; both project files are available in HTML and Jupyter Notebook versions, with the former compressed together in a zip file due to file-size-upload limitation of GitHub.
